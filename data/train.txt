'and now the end is near and so i face the final curtain my friend i say it clear i state my case of which i certain i lived a life that full i traveled each and every highway and more much more than this i did it my way regrets i had a few but then again too few to mention i did what i had to do and saw it through without exemption i planned each charted course each careful step along the byway oh and more much more than this i did it my way yes there were times i sure you knew when i bit off more than i could chew but through it all when there was doubt i ate it up and spit it out i faced it all and i stood tall and did it my way i loved i laughed and cried i had my fails my share of losing and now as tears subside i find it all so amusing to think i did all that and may i say not in a shy way oh no no not me i did it my way for what is a man what has he got if not himself then he has not to say the words he truly feels and not the words from one who kneels the record shows i took the blows and did it my way the record shows i took the blows and did it my way'
